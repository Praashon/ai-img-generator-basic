# AI Image Generator Basic

This project is a web-based application for generating images using various AI models. I've developed a clean, responsive front-end interface that allows users to input prompts and select parameters for image generation.

## What I've Done So Far

I've implemented the core HTML structure and comprehensive CSS styling. The application features a form-based interface where users can enter text prompts, choose from multiple AI models, specify image count and dimensions, and generate images. The UI includes a gallery grid for displaying results, download buttons for each image, and a theme toggle for dark/light modes. JavaScript integration is planned for handling API calls and dynamic functionality.

## Features

- **Prompt Input**: Text area for describing desired images with autofocus and validation
- **Model Selection**: Dropdown menu with options including FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-schnell, Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion v1.5, and Openjourney
- **Image Configuration**: Selectable options for image count (1-4) and aspect ratios (square, portrait, landscape)
- **Generation Interface**: Submit button with icon for initiating image generation
- **Gallery Display**: Grid layout showing generated images with loading states and error handling
- **Download Functionality**: Individual download buttons for each generated image
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes with smooth transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Custom properties for theming, CSS Grid for layout, Flexbox for alignment, and responsive design with media queries
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for future DOM manipulation and API integration
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family for typography

The project uses modern web standards and best practices for performance and maintainability.
